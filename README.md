Problem Statement Title : Integrated Platform for Crowdsourced Ocean Hazard Reporting and Social Media Analytics

Description	:
About INCOIS

The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), operating under the administrative control of the Ministry of Earth Sciences, provides ocean information and advisory services to support disaster risk reduction and ensure maritime safety for coastal stakeholders. Its early warning services cover hazards such as tsunamis, storm surges, high waves, swell surges, and coastal currents, enabling authorities and communities to make informed decisions during ocean-related emergencies.

Background

India’s vast coastline is vulnerable to a range of ocean hazards such as tsunamis, storm surges, high waves, coastal currents, and abnormal sea behaviour. While agencies like INCOIS provide early warnings based on satellite data, sensors, and numerical models; real-time field reporting from citizens and local communities are often unavailable or delayed. Additionally, valuable insights from public discussions on social media during hazard events remain untapped, yet can be critical for understanding ground realities, public awareness, and the spread of information.

Detailed Description

There is a need for a unified platform that enables citizens, coastal residents, volunteers, and disaster managers to report observations during hazardous ocean events (e.g., unusual tides, flooding, coastal damage, tsunami, swell surges, high waves, etc.) and to monitor public communication trends via social media.

This platform should:
• Allow citizens to submit geotagged reports, photos, or videos of observed ocean hazards via a mobile/web app.
• Support role-based access for citizens, officials, and analysts.
• Aggregate and visualize real-time crowdsourced data on a dynamic dashboard.
• Visualize all crowdsourced reports and social media indicators on an interactive map, with hotspots dynamically generated based on report density, keyword frequency, or verified incidents.
• Integrate social media feeds (e.g., Twitter, public Facebook posts, YouTube comments) and apply Text Classification/Natural Language Processing to extract hazard-related discussions and trends.
• Help emergency response agencies understand the scale, urgency, and sentiment of hazard events.
• Provide filters by location, event type, date, and source, enabling better situational awareness and faster validation of warning models.

Expected Solution

An integrated software platform (mobile + web) with:
• User registration and reporting interface with media upload.
• Map-based dashboard showing live crowd reports and social media activity.
• Dynamic hotspot generation based on report volume or verified threat indicators.
• Backend database and API for data management and integration with early warning systems.
• NLP engine for detecting relevant hazard-related posts, keywords, and engagement metrics.
• Multilingual support for regional accessibility.
• Offline data collection capabilities (sync later), useful for remote coastal areas.

Problem Statement Title : Centralised Digital Platform for Comprehensive student activity record in HEIs

Description	: 
Background:
Despite increasing digitization in education, student achievements ranging from academic excellence to participation in curricular and extracurricular activities remain scattered across various departments or lost in paper-based records, in many colleges and universities. There is no centralized digital platform that enables institutions to document, track, and showcase a student's complete profile, including:
- Conferences and workshops attended
- Certifications earned
- Club activities and volunteering efforts
- Competitions and academic contests
- Leadership roles and internships
- Community services done

This gap not only hampers institutional efficiency but also limits students' ability to build a verified and dynamic portfolio that could support job applications, higher education admissions, and skill recognition. In addition, during events like NAAC accreditation, the lack of consolidated data becomes a major administrative challenge.

Description:
The above problem necessitates the development of a Smart Student Hub (Mobile + Web Application) that acts as a centralized student record and achievement management platform.

Key Features include:
- Dynamic Student Dashboard: Real-time updates on academic performance, attendance, and credit-based activities.
- Activity Tracker: Upload and validate participation in seminars, conferences, online courses (e.g., MOOCs), internships, and extra-curriculars.
- Faculty Approval Panel: Faculty or admin can approve uploaded records to maintain credibility.
- Auto-Generated Digital Portfolio: Downloadable and shareable verified student portfolio in PDF or web link format.
- Analytics & Reporting: For institutions to generate reports for NAAC, AICTE, NIRF, or internal evaluations.
- Integration Support: Can link with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS), ERP, or digital university platforms.

Impact and Benefits:
- Empowers students with a verified, holistic digital profile.
- Facilitates career planning, placements, and scholarship/higher studies applications.
- Reduces administrative burden during audits and accreditations.
- Encourages participation in co-curricular activities by making achievements visible and valued.
- Promotes data-driven decision-making at the institutional level.

Expected Solution:
We propose the development of a mobile + web-based application that can digitally catalogue and manage a student's academic and non-academic achievements throughout their time in college. The proposed protocol will:
- Build a verified, holistic student profile from Day 1
- Reduce paperwork and improve transparency
- Make students better prepared for placements, fellowships, or postgraduate admissions
- Empower faculty with real-time data for mentoring and tracking
- Align with the digital transformation goals of higher education institutions
- Enhance institutional efficiency during accreditation or policy audits

This will bridge the gap by offering an all-in-one solution that empowers students, simplifies faculty tasks, and modernizes institutional operations.
